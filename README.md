Typeahead.js on ArcGIS
===================

This little example demonstrate how to using this fantastic autocomplete search tool on ArcGIS Online feature services.

The purpose here is to search multiple feature services from the same <Input>, display filtered results and once the selection done, get the essential information to do something with the selection, here we choose to get back the ObjectID of the selection, along with the selection's dataset of course. One could think about getting the features geometries from ArcGIS Online et use them right away after selection to zoom on the selected data...

Next we'll add a map to the App !
